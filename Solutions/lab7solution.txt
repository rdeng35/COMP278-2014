Maximum

Write out source code for a function that computes the maximum of two numbers. (Yes, I know practically every language has a max(a,b) function, I want you to write your own version).

public void greater (int a, int b)
int greater; 
{if (a>=b)
greater = a;
else 
greater = b;
}
Write out equivalent assembly code for source code. One stipulation: the two numbers should be loaded from RAM. 
Hint: the STOR instruction doesnâ€™t work. Store the result into a register. To move data from Rs to Rd, ADD Rd, Rs, R0 (R0 is constant 0).
;R1=0x01
;R2=0x02
;R3


0	LOAD R1, 0x01
1 	LOAD R2, 0x02
2 	LOAD R4, 0x00
3	SUB R3,R1,R2
4	JZG R3, 8
5	SUB R3,R2,R1
6	JZG R3,9
7	JZE R0 B
8	ADD R3,R1,R4
9	ADD R3,R2,R4	


Write out equivalent machine code, and test it in Logisim, using the supplied CPU in circuits/cpu-16bit.circ. Save the contents of RAM as lab7max.txt.

Sum

Write out source code for a function that computes the sum of an array of integers. (Yes, I know practically every language has a sum(array) function, 
I want you to write your own version). Write it with the assumption that the length is given separately from the array: int sum(int length, int[] array);

Write out equivalent assembly code for source code. One stipulation: the array should be loaded from RAM, and the size of the array should be read first. Hint: use the LOAD Ra instruction (opcode d in hex).
